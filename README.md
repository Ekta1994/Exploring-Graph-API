# Exploring-Graph-API
The script downloads the profile pictures of facebook friends using Graph API.

Graph API is a low level HTTP based API which lets you play with the data on facebook. We can use it to query data, post updates, get content from your account and much more.

The basics of API can be read from here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview/

For working with this API, we'll need an ACCESS TOKEN. The instructions for generating the same are mentioned on the above link (Select user_friends field in User Data Permissions while generating the token).
